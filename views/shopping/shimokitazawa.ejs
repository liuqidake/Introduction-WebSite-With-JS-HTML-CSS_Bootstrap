            The many theaters, live music venues, art galleries, cozy cafes and izakayas 
            in Shimokitazawa are gathering places for like-minded people to hang out while 
            enjoying good quality art and entertainment created mostly by independent artists. 
            In fact, Shimokita is often called "the town of music", as there are arguably at 
            least 50 live music venues in the area. It is also known as "the town of theater" 
            because of its well-established theaters and annual performing arts festival.
