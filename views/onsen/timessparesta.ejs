                One of the classiest spa complexes in central Tokyo, Spa Resta occupies 
                an unlikely location: floors 10 to 12 of the Times Station parking garage 
                and car rental facility in Ikebukuro. Don't let that get in your way though, 
                as this spot is perfect for a long, lazy day of soaking, eating and relaxing.

            The men's side has a wide range of baths, a Finnish-style sauna, rotenburo and even 
            a terrace area with deck chairs, while women can look forward to an open-air jacuzzi, 
            a 'clear mist' sauna complete with refreshing aroma, and other beauty-enhancing facilities. 
            The treatment menu includes Thai massage, foot care, ayurvedic massage, Korean body scrubs 
            and much more, while you'll also find a unisex 'relaxation lounge' and a reservations-only 
            'premium lounge' bookable for ¥500 per hour (or ¥1,700 for an entire night!). Just note that 
            anyone with tattoos or under the age of 18 will not be admitted.
